b. Show estimator $\hat x$ is unbiased, ie that $E(\hat x) = x$

Let $z_i = x + \epslson_i$ where $z_i$ is the individual signal from a sensor consisting of the true signal $x$ and random, indpendent noise with a variance of $\sigma_i^2$, $\epsilon_i$.

Let $\hat x = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^3w_i z_i }{\sum_{i=1}^3w_i}$, where $w_i$ is an unknown constant weight.

The expectitation of the estimator $\hat x$ would then equal:

$$E(\hat x) = E(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i z_i}{\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i})$$

Subusituting our definition of $z_i$ we get:
$$E(\hat x) = E(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i (x + \epsilon_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i})$$

Separating and simplyfing we find:
$$E(\hat x) = E(x + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i \epsilon_i}{\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i})$$

Since the expectation of the true quantity $x$ is $x$, we get:
$$E( \hat) = x + E(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i \epsilon_i}{\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i})$$
